# What is this plugin?
In the 1.50 update of ETS2 and ATS a new problem came with their cache changes <br>
This problem caused the game to only load cached versions of saves unless they where remade by the game itself<br>

This meant that save editors and local modders had to find ways to fix this problem and ended up with needing to remake their save before loading it every time<br>

This plugin makes it so that the cache is ALWAYS cleared before you load your save making sure your game read the file itself and not a cached version<br>

Bringing it back to how save editing and local modding use to be

# How to use
1.) Open Steam<br>
2.) Right click ETS2/ATS and go to `Manage > Browse Local Files`<br>
3.) Open `Bin > win_x64`<br>
4.) Download the plugin (https://github.com/Baldywaldy09/Prism3D-Cache-Fix/releases/latest)<br>
5.) Inside the downloaded zip extract the `.dll` file `PrismCacheFix.dll` into the folder you opened earlier (`plugins`)<br>
6.) Open/Restart your game and the plugin should start working!<br>
